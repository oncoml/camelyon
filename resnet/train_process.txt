Training process

I --- With one set of images (~/Data2T/tile_images_old/resnet)
1. Resnet50 model
   Learning rate = 0.010
   Epoch = 1
   Batch size = 4
   Binary Cross Entropy with Logits
   Adam optimizer
   model.params trained = True
   Saved model backup file = 'tumor_model_1.pth'
   
2. Learning rate = 0.002
   Epoch = 1
   Batch size = 4
   model.params trained = True
   Saved model backup file = 'tumor_model_2.pth'


II --- With new set of images (~/projects/camelyon17/tile_wsi/resnet/)
1. Resnet 50 model
   Learning rate = 0.010
   Epoch = 1
   Batch size = 8
   Binary Cross Entropy with Logits
   Adam optimzier
   model.params trained = True
   Saved model backup file = 'tumor_model_a.pth'
